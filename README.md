# Consecutive_element_differences_in_Permutations
Based on an online entrace problem. 
Coins with values 1 through N (inclusive) are placed into a bag. All the coins from the bag are iteratively drawn (without replacement) at random. For the first coin, you are paid the value of the coin. For the subsequent coins, you are paid the absolute difference between the drawn coin and the previously drawn coin. For example, if you drew 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, your payments would be 5, 2, 1, 2, 3 for a total payment of 13. 
Compute the following:
1. What is the mean of your total payment for N=10?
2. What is the standard deviation of your total payment for N=10?
3. What is the mean of your total payment for N=20?
4. What is the standard deviation of your total payment for N=20?
5. What is the probability that your total payment is greater than or equal to 160 for N=20?
